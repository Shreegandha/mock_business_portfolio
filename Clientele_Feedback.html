This company has changed my lifestyle for the better. As a female rights activist, I take pride in wearing their clothing. When I was younger, I was picked on in my foster family’s household for being the only girl in the family and not playing any sports. I’m thankful for this company, as its clothing has given me the confidence I need when wearing my clothes. Although people may question the dedication of a clothing company to working it’s way up to female rights, as a loyal customer, I believe that they’re on the right path.

Although I may not be a woman, I have a wife and kids who absolutely love the clothes this company produces. We go to a mall nearby once in a while and each time we go, my daughters always want to buy headbands at Culture’s Fashion for soccer. Luckily, they’ve stopped complaining about their hair always in their face but with their headbands, they’re content and can play better. My wife always purchases their tees, mainly the ones with powerful statements on them, such as “Unleash your Inner Feminism”.

My sister is 16 years old and I’m so grateful for her to be interested in women's rights, especially at such a young age. I myself am a women’s rights activist and have been interested in this company since the beginning of it’s opening. I can ensure that it has made a meaningful impact on feminism with it’s strikes for equal gender pay. My sister and I are looking forward to participating in the marathon while wearing their fashionable, comfortable clothing. My friends have protested with a few of the employees there on the anti-bullying stands that they have. I remembered they had one last year of November and my friends thought it was informative and eye-opening.

I recently made a purchase there and noticed that they had a deal: if we made a $90 purchase or above, then we would get a free pass to the Paris Fashion Week fashion show. Not to mention, the material of the clothing was durable and super comfortable! Shipping is free during any of their sales, which they typically have from time to time.
