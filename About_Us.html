<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;"> Welcome to our webpage! We’re the creators of Culture’s Fashion and we hope our bold statements within our fashion choices positively influence you to be confident in what you believe in, spread kindness to others, and make the right choices. We revolve around a women’s clothing line with cheap prices and great quality. We have over 300 locations all across the US with over 150,000 employees working in each store. Our company not only focuses on staying up-to-date with today’s fashion trends but we also have participated in several issues and movements that have sparked nationwide recognition. We’ve participated in anti-bullying movements, have taken stands to address gender wage equality, and have spread many ideals of feminism, which is what we’re most known for. </p>
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;"> Our company was created in 2018 by the CEO, Shreegandha Kulkarni. Being interested in not only the art of fashion, but also social and political reforms at a young age, she had set her mind to combining the two things she loves most and has inspired many to challenge each other’s viewpoints and come to a consensus to strive for peace in today's world. With her confidence and kindness, she’s built a strong foundation of her dreams and many others too.</p>
  <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;"> With the combination of many people’s stories being shared out, we’d decided that this company would need recognition for the causes we wanted people to become aware of. We have to embrace the fact that fashion is the embodiment of character and soul. Clothing is merely one of the ways we can help our generation prosper through difficult situations, and at the same time, support various dreams. With our modern and trendy clothing styles, we’re bound to become the first generation to not only adopt the most boldest fashion choices but also embrace the purity of defining who we are and shouting out our beliefs to the world.</p>
