<p class="shree-text"> PARIS FASHION WEEK:
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">In our past years, we’ve accomplished many tasks that have positively impacted not only women, but a community. We’ve inspired many to take a stand for any cause that they believe in, such as gun control or political movements, and we’ve challenged others to put their best and honest effort into their interests. With our clothing, feminism has moved up a level and has achieved rights that has been set in stone, however, not so much the equality. With the support that we get from our customers, we’ve gained popularity in causes that aid in reaching equality for both men and women. We’re in this for the long run. </p>
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">One of our past projects to help promote the ideologies of feminism and gender equality was helping run a fashion show on October 2, 2019. This fashion show was held in Paris during Paris Fashion Week where a few of our new collections were worn by some of the most famous models in the world. As they proudly walked on the runway, we were reminded of the hard-working production staff we have. In less than six months,our staff had accomplished manufacturing the right amount of clothing pieces precisely with the exact designs we showed them as a guide. Without the effort and time our workers put into creating our durable material and beautiful embroideries, we wouldn’t have the confidence to call our business,“Culture’s Fashion,” a success.
</p>
  <p class="shree-text"> 2020 DONNA Breast Cancer Marathon:
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">
We’re honored to have been chosen by the 2020 DONNA Breast Cancer Marathon leaders to create and sponsor fitness wear for women running in the marathon. When we were offered this grand position, we had taken it to our hearts how these brave women unified and brought together an unfortunate form of cancer and turn it into something that is powerful to overcome. We did not think twice when taking this enriching opportunity under our wing and to spread the idea of unification and strength. Although people have known us to be a company that immerses itself into the blend of streetwear and sophistication, taking this task is our ultimate mission to creating a sustaining bond between society and feminism, respectable.  </p>
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">The types of athletic wear that we are in the process of making includes high waisted leggings, to look chic while breaking a sweat, lightweight, easy-to-move-in muscle tanks to show off those strong muscles, as well as comfortable headbands to keep that luscious hair out of your game face. Along with sportswear, we’ll be producing warm, light pink sweatshirts for the people on the sidelines cheering their loved ones on. We support anyone who strongly believes in a good cause, whether they’re the watchers or participaters. We’ve still been debating about the costs for each piece of clothing; however, we aim to make it affordable for all. All proceeds will be donated to the American Breast Cancer Foundation (ABCF). The prices so far are the following: </p>

<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">“In love, there lies leggings”: $15</p> 
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">“Strive in muscle tanks”: $10 </p>
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">“Work hard headband”: $7 </p>
	<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">Ever since we started this project in January 2019, we’ve worked diligently and strategically to receive the best results from our consumers. In the month of March, we posted our designs on our social media to receive feedback. The results were quite astounding: 500 people voted on our light pink chevron designed leggings over the 752 participants in liking a white and pink polka dot design, 993 people voted on the white and pink muscle tanks over the 307 who went with pinks striped muscle tanks, and 330 people voted for the white headband over the black. Based on the results, we noticed people had gone with optimistic colors to express their support for not only the event but our products. </p> 
<p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;">Our ultimate goal is to spread love and support for the strong women who have overcome breast cancer. These brave women will never have to feel incapable or reserved about not only their power to overcome this challenege but their fashion choices. They’ll always have “Culture’s Fashion” to aid their needs and care for them. We love you survivors! Keep rocking! For more information on this marathon, visit
